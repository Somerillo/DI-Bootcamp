ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Advanced Medal Analysis

Olympic Data

Task 1: Identify competitors who have won medals in both individual 
and team events, and calculate the total number of medals they have 
won in each category. Create a temporary table to store the results 
and ensure it includes their full name, total medals in individual 
events, and total medals in team events.
