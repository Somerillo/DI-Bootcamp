I am not upset but furious for the fact that i paid 30k ILS for a DA course that every-single-week
shows only improvisation. It wasnt only once or twice, and today it was the worst of all.
Spending one and a half hour trying simply to start the exercice and after that spend another 4
hours to see how to connect the tables, to finally be able to make the exercise

NOT EVEN A BRIEF COLUMN MAP OR DESCRIPTION???? 

I am not complaining about the teachers but about the organization.



-- Task 1: Find the average age of competitors who have won at least one medal, 
-- grouped by the type of medal they won. Use a correlated subquery to achieve this.

-- Avoiding Correlated Subqueries: Use joins instead of correlated subqueries when possible, 
-- as joins are generally more efficient. Correlated subqueries are executed once for each row processed
-- by the outer query, which can be slow. Joins, on the other hand,
-- combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns, and are usually faster.
