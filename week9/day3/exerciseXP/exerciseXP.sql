    Create a temporary table that join all tables and create a new one using LEFT JOIN.
    Create an unique identifier code between the columns ‚Äòemployee_id‚Äô and ‚Äòdate‚Äô and call it ‚Äòid‚Äô.
    Convert the column ‚Äòdate‚Äô to DATE type because it was previously configured as TIMESTAMP.
    Transform this new table into a dataset ‚Äúdf_employee‚Äù for analysis.
