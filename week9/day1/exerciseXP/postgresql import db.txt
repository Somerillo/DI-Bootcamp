Step 1: Load All SQL Files into a Single Database
You must first execute all your SQL files into a PostgreSQL database. Follow these steps:
 1. Create a New Database:
 - In pgAdmin:
	- Right-click Databases in the Browser panel.
	- Select Create > Database.
	- Enter a name for the database 'combined_db' and click Save.
 2. Import Each SQL File:
 - Open the Query Tool for the new database.
 - For each '.sql' file:
	a. Load the file by clicking File > Open File... in the Query Tool.
	b. Click the Execute/Refresh button (lightning bolt icon) to execute the SQL commands.
 - Repeat until all SQL files have been loaded into the database.

Step 2: Create a '.backup' or '.tar' File
Once all SQL files are executed into the database, you can back up the entire database.
Using pgAdmin:
 1. Right-Click on the Database:
	- In the Browser panel, right-click the database ('combined_db').
	- Select Backup....
 2. Configure Backup Options:
	- In the Backup Database dialog:
	- Filename: Click the '...' button and specify a location and name for your backup file like  'combined_db.backup'.
 3. Start the Backup:
	- Click Backup to generate the file.
	- A '.backup' or '.tar' file will be created in the specified location.
	- Then with this file, you can go to Restore and select it.
